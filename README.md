# sopel-spongemock
Sopel plugin to generate "Spongemock" text (based on *that* SpongeBob meme)

## Requirements

Only [Sopel](https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel) itself, but this plugin needs
features added for Sopel 7.0 (so, at time of writing, the version of Sopel on
PyPI will not load this file).
